# Password-Generator

Project consists of several functions that randomly select characters from an array via the Math.random() function after the user has 
answered a number of prompts:

If the user input does not follow the guidelines given in the prompt, the user is then asked to re-enter
their response.

Otherwise, the input given is run through a for loop which contains the Math functions in a variable called "pOutput".

That value is then placed into a string called "generatedPassword". The site then outputs the random string in the Password box.
